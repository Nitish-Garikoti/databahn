How to Run
Follow these steps to get the application running locally.

1. Setup Python Environment
First, create and activate a Python virtual environment.

Bash

# Create a virtual environment using Python 3.12
python3.12 -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate
2. Install Dependencies
Use Poetry to install the required project dependencies.

Bash

poetry install
3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a .env file in the root directory of the project and add your OpenAI API key.

Code snippet

OPENAI_API_KEY="your-secret-key-here"
4. Configure Cloudflare MCP Server (Optional)
This project can integrate with a Cloudflare MCP server.

To use the Cloudflare server:

Ensure you have a Cloudflare account.

In a separate terminal, run the following command to authenticate your session:

Bash

npx mcp-remote [https://browser.mcp.cloudflare.com/sse](https://browser.mcp.cloudflare.com/sse)
To NOT use the Cloudflare server:

In app.py, find and comment out the lines related to "cloudflare_browser_params", "cf_read", and "cf_write".

5. Start the Application
Finally, start the FastAPI server using Uvicorn.

Bash

poetry run uvicorn app:app --port 8001
The application will now be running at http://127.0.0.1:8001. ðŸš€
