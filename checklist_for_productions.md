# Improvements that need to be made to push this to production

* using config to initialize

* saving the logs - mongodb

* state management - current state management is shared state management i.e. different users will have same state object used as I defined a global redis_object. But onceÂ we move to state per user_id using redis cache this will be solved. 

* cost/metrics using langfuse

* prompt engineering:
    1. I have added JSON schema of tables RAG on manual tools  but this is not perfect.  I haven't added the RAG for mcp tool doc strings but that possible too using resources. Even in manual tools RAG its better if we do html tagging extraction of tables and then RAG and put back the appropriate tables. I currently used a table that has all other table info - This will be problematic if we have more tools with different tables.
    2. Add RAG on MCP tools and each tool MCP tables.
    3. Add few shot examples
    4. Dynamic system prompting - Currently static prompt and I can add this dynamically - tables and also few shot examples.

* Fine tuning(orchestrator)

* make jinja resposne and render the data to look it more appealing on UI

* latencies in debug_obj

* multiple mcp servers or module based agentic approach

* streaming

* Limit the number of responses returned by the SQL query(I did it default at 10) but this has to be product dependent.

* benchmark and evaluation

* follow up questions
